# cc_kern_inv
A seismological code in Python: this is a package for full waveform ambient noise inversion for sources or structure. Overview of directory structure:

- the source inversion code is in "anseicca". 
- structure inversion code is under development.
- modules that are common to source and structure inversion, are in "modules_common".
